# mastermind
This project is a command line based mastermind game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). A player can choose to be either the codemaker or codebreaker against the computer. The code consists of colors represented by their first letter ['R', 'B', 'G', 'P', 'Y', 'M']. The default setup is a code with 5 slots and the codebreaker gets 8 turns to guess it (can be changed in the mastermind class constructor). If player is the codebreaker, computer will give appropriate clues for each turn (! - correct slot guess, ? - correct color but wrong slot, X - incorrect color).
